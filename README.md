# Bloom 

# Motivation
I attended Flatiron schoolbootcamp during all the events that transpired in 2020, I had to find ways to maintain wellness and wellbeing. I came across the healing properties of crystals and realized people have different ways of using crystals.

For fun I thought it would be cool to create a web platform where individuals could exchange the knowledge of stone's healing properties. Users can submit comments to share information. Users can also save favorited crystals to favorites list.
